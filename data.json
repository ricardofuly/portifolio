  "about": [
    "For me, game development is about combining creativity and engineering to create experiences that truly connect people.",
    "Over <strong>3 years of experience in game development</strong>, I have been turning ideas into playable systems, exploring mechanics, performance, and design in a practical and consistent way.",
    "I have <strong>1 year of professional experience with Unreal Engine 5</strong>, working with <strong>C++ and Unreal Blueprints</strong> to create mechanics, gameplay systems, and reusable tools. I have a strong interest in clean architecture, scalable solutions, and code that makes sense both for the project and the team.",
    "Beyond Unreal, I am constantly expanding my technical skill set. Currently, I am <strong>learning Unity and C#</strong>, exploring new development approaches, architectural patterns, and different production pipelines, which broadens my versatility as a developer.",
    "I strongly believe in teamwork and enjoy collaborating with artists, designers, and other programmers—exchanging ideas, rapidly prototyping, and refining systems until the final experience is cohesive, immersive, and fun to play.",
    "My goal is to create games that not only work well, but also leave a lasting impact on the player."
