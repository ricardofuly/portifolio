  "about": [
    "For me, game development is about combining creativity and engineering to create experiences that truly connect people. Over <strong>3 years of experience in game development</strong>, I have been turning ideas into playable systems, exploring mechanics, performance, and design in a practical and consistent way.",
    "I have <strong>1 year of professional experience with Unreal Engine 5</strong>, working with <strong>C++ and Unreal Blueprints</strong> to create mechanics, gameplay systems, and reusable tools. Beyond Unreal, I am constantly expanding my technical skill set—currently <strong>learning Unity and C#</strong>, exploring new development approaches and architectural patterns to broaden my versatility.",
    "I strongly believe in teamwork and enjoy collaborating with artists, designers, and other programmers to refine systems until the final experience is cohesive, immersive, and fun to play. My goal is to create games that not only work well, but also leave a lasting impact on the player."
