  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>
    For me, game development is about combining creativity and engineering to create
    experiences that truly connect people.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over <strong>3 years of experience in game development</strong>, I have been turning
    ideas into playable systems, exploring mechanics, performance, and design in a
    practical and consistent way.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have <strong>1 year of professional experience with Unreal Engine 5</strong>,
    working with <strong>C++ and Unreal Blueprints</strong> to create mechanics,
    gameplay systems, and reusable tools. I have a strong interest in clean architecture,
    scalable solutions, and code that makes sense both for the project and the team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond Unreal, I am constantly expanding my technical skill set.
    Currently, I am <strong>learning Unity and C#</strong>, exploring new development
    approaches, architectural patterns, and different production pipelines, which
    broadens my versatility as a developer.
  </p>

  <p>
    I strongly believe in teamwork and enjoy collaborating with artists, designers, and
    other programmers—exchanging ideas, rapidly prototyping, and refining systems until
    the final experience is cohesive, immersive, and fun to play.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to create games that not only work well, but also leave a lasting impact
    on the player.
